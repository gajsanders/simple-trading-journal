   - Create app.py as the main file
   - Create requirements.txt with streamlit and pandas
   - Create a data/ directory
   - Create README.md with basic project description

2. Implement a Trade data model using Python dataclass:
   - Fields: date (str), symbol (str), strategy (str), entry_price (float), exit_price (float), quantity (int), pnl (float), notes (str), status (str)
   - Include type hints and docstring
   - Add a method to convert trade to dictionary
   - Add a class method to create trade from dictionary

3. Create basic utility functions:
   - calculate_pnl(entry_price: float, exit_price: float, quantity: int) -> float
   - validate_trade_data(trade_dict: dict) -> bool
   - get_strategy_options() -> list (return predefined strategy options from spec)

4. Write comprehensive unit tests for all functions using pytest
   - Test the Trade dataclass creation and methods
   - Test P&L calculation with various scenarios (long/short positions)
   - Test data validation with valid and invalid inputs

```

***

### Prompt 2: CSV File Operations

```
Building on the previous Trade data model, implement CSV file operations with full testing:

1. Create a TradeStorage class to handle all file I/O operations:
   - __init__(self, filename: str = "data/trades.csv")
   - load_trades(self) -> List[Trade] - load trades from CSV, return empty list if file doesn't exist
   - save_trades(self, trades: List[Trade]) -> None - save trades to CSV
   - add_trade(self, trade: Trade) -> None - append single trade to existing data
   - get_trades_df(self) -> pd.DataFrame - return trades as pandas DataFrame

2. Handle CSV operations properly:
   - Create data directory if it doesn't exist
   - Handle missing file gracefully (create new CSV with headers)
   - Proper CSV headers matching Trade dataclass fields
   - Handle empty CSV files
   - Ensure data type consistency when loading

3. Add comprehensive error handling:
   - File permission issues

7. Add comprehensive testing suite:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for complete workflows
   - Performance benchmarks
   - User acceptance test scenarios
   - Edge case handling verification

8. Create documentation and help system:
   - In-app help with searchable FAQ
   - Getting started tutorial/wizard
   - Feature documentation with examples
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Keyboard shortcut reference

9. Final integration and polish:
   - Ensure all components work seamlessly together
   - Clean up code organization and structure
   - Add consistent styling and theming
   - Optimize app startup time
   - Final UI/UX improvements

10. Production deployment preparation:
    - Requirements.txt finalization
    - README.md with installation and usage instructions
    - Configuration file examples
    - Deployment scripts or instructions
    - Version numbering and release notes

11. Quality assurance checklist:
    - All features work as specified
    - No orphaned or unused code
    - Consistent error handling throughout
    - All user interactions provide feedback
    - Data integrity maintained in all scenarios
    - Performance acceptable with realistic datasets

12. Create release package:
    - Final code review and cleanup
    - Complete documentation package
    - Sample data files for testing
    - Installation verification script
    - User feedback collection system

The final application should be a polished, user-friendly, and robust trading journal that meets all specifications while providing an excellent user experience. Focus on reliability, ease of use, and maintainability.

## Summary

This blueprint provides a comprehensive, step-by-step development plan for the Simple Trading Journal project. Each prompt builds incrementally on the previous ones, ensuring:

- **Test-driven development** with comprehensive testing at each step
- **No orphaned code** - every component integrates with existing functionality  
- **Incremental complexity** - each step adds meaningful functionality without overwhelming jumps
- **Production-ready output** - the final application meets all specification requirements

The 12 prompts progress logically from foundation (data models, file I/O) through core functionality (UI, business logic) to advanced features (import/export, analytics) and finally to production polish. Each prompt is sized appropriately for implementation by an LLM while maintaining quality and testing standards.
